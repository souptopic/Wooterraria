# Wooterraria

## (Proof of concept, for now)

A Terraria mod that (should in the future) adds RGB flare to Wooting Keyboards.

Currently only highlights the quick heal key when on low health.

Also features a janky dll setup for the wooting-rgb-sdk.dll, don't ask.

You are free to ask me to take over, I just made this for fun.

You can also use this as a base for your own mod, just give credit where it's due.
